# TGCP---Intro-to-C-Plus-Plus
//This repository will maintain code that I write for TGCP - Intro to C++

//I want to have the work that I complete for this course in one place so that I can reference it when building a portfolio.

//Hello, World!

//Lecture 1: Compiling your first C++ program:

//Prompt: Write a program that prints "Howdy" then my name

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Howdy, Alex!" << endl;
}

//Prompt: Write a program that will display my name and address in the same format at as letter

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Alex" << endl;
    cout << "123 Down Street" << endl;
    cout << "Seattle, WA 98101" << endl;
}

//Final thoughts: Great overall view of what C++ is used for and a simple exercise to demonstrate the language
